# BlackJack Project
Raymond Pridgen, in CS207-02 with Professor David Blair 
This project is a simple Blackjack game coded in C++, made for an assignment. It includes a very basic commandline interaface, and upon running it, one game of blackjack can be played against a specified number of CPUs and a dealer. The threshold can be changed for all players as well. The game contains a card and a deck object, so there is full blackjack logic implemented.
