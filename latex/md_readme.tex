Raymond Pridgen, in CS207-\/02 with Professor David Blair \hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Function to make a deck of cards\+: Create\+Deck\+Of\+Card()}{Function to make a deck of cards\+: Create\+Deck\+Of\+Card()}}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md11}
This part was relatively easy, I just had to look over the class of a card, and then use the vector functionality for a list. So, I made a loop and another nested one to iterate through each suit and value, to then place each card object in the vector. \hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Function to shuffle a deck of cards\+: Shuffle()}{Function to shuffle a deck of cards\+: Shuffle()}}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md12}
This function took a little more mental gymnastics, but I figured it out. To start, I needed a random number. I used the random number generator rand(), which is seeded with the comptuer clock. I also used the mod \% operator to make the random number fall within the range of the deck of cards. Then, I used the vector functions .push\+\_\+back() and .erase() to find a random card in the list, remove it, and place it at the back. Finally I iterate that process 200 times to make sure the deck is thoroughly shuffled. This fucntion also takes a reference, so it actually shuffles the original deck, instead of makign a copy and returning a whole new deck. \hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Function to print a deck of cards to the console\+: To\+String()}{Function to print a deck of cards to the console\+: To\+String()}}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md13}
This function was about as simple as the first one. All I did was use the .To\+String() function from the Card.\+cpp file. First, I iterated through the vector of Cards, then used the To\+String function to print each one out. \hypertarget{md_readme_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Quick main code to deal four cards from a shuffled deck}{Quick main code to deal four cards from a shuffled deck}}\label{md_readme_autotoc_md14}
Finally, I used all these functions to show that each part works, and then I dealt four cards by printing four from the back of the list to the console. I also used .pop\+\_\+back() and .push\+\_\+back() to remove the dealt cards from the deck, and added them to a list to mark cards already dealt.
